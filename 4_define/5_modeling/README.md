# Modeling
So far, we have discussed how to precisely define the data. Now it's time to 
discuss how to precisely define the problem itself.

## Type of modeling techniques
The first thing to notice is that modeling is a very broad topic and 
modeling techniques vary significantly from problem to problem.

In machine learning, for example, people usually classify problems according 
to the modeling technique: Is it a supervised or an unsupervised learning 
problem? If it's supervised, is it a regression or a classification problem?

In operations research, problems can be modeled using simulation, linear 
programming, or constraint programming, for instance. Again, the right 
choice highly depends on the problem and available resources to solve
the problem.

Choosing the right modeling technique for a given problem requires skills 
that you will need to develop. Of course, it's insane to think that someone 
would be able to learn how to model with all the available techniques. In 
addition, with the choice of a modeling technique, we are implicitly 
converging towards a small subset of algorithms which we also need to 
dominate in order to solve the problem.

## Prioritizing what techniques to learn
Given that there are so many modeling techniques, you need to prioritize 
what to focus on. For that, make sure to consider the types of problems that 
you are most interested in and your current skills. 

In addition, it's important to keep a close eye on the trends in the market. 
For example, at the time we wrote this, there were many modeling processes
in machine learning that were being completely automated. 

Similarly, in the operations research world, dynamic programming has been 
largely replaced with mixed-integer programming techniques because the 
latter is more representative and optimization solvers have become 
incredibly more powerful than they used to be in the 80s and 90s. 

We know that this information doesn't help you much in defining your
priorities, but we hope that it gives you some awareness to make a more
informed decision. Also, we strongly encourage you to have a chat
with your Mip Mentor now. He will definitely help you design a path
that makes sense for you.

## Choosing the best technique for real-world projects 
Many times throughout your career, you will find yourself in a situation 
where you don't know how to model and solve a particular problem. It 
happens to all of us. At that time, you will see how invaluable it is to be 
supported by a community like Mip Wise. In fact, support is the only thing 
we can guarantee, really. Everything else is a challenge and opportunity to 
innovate!
