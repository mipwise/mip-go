# Define
Welcome to the *Define* module, which comes from the second "D" of the 
[D-Wise](../1_introduction/1_overview/README.md) framework.

In the Discovery module, we discussed the importance of understanding the 
problem and its context before moving on to solving it. So, by now, you should
have some sort of documentation that defines several aspects of a problem 
that you are motivated to solve. And that's great! We hope you enjoy that 
exercise, which you will find yourself doing every time you engage in a new 
project.

Below is a quick overview of data, modeling, and algorithms. After that, we 
will dive into some more details about each topic and provide practical tips 
to make your project very successful.

## Data
The raw material to solve data analytics problems is *data*. And the outcome 
is also data. So, once we have a fair understanding of the problem, we can
begin to define the input and output data. This process typically begins in 
a very loose manner and gains more structure as we make progress.

The process of defining the data is an extension of the discovery phase. 
It's always surprising to see how much clarity we gain about the problem
after defining its input and output data, especially when clients are also 
engaged in this exercise.

## Modeling
If you review the documentation you've put together for this problem of 
yours and assume that it's a real-world problem, you must admit that your
description of the problem is full of ambiguities (perhaps not so much 
after defining the data). This is not to say that you did a bad job, which you
probably did if this was your first time doing this exercise. But this is 
not the point.

The point is that there is a key distinction between *description* and 
*representation* of a problem. Description is art, representation is science.
Description is ambiguous, representation is precise. 

Why is it important to make such a distinction?

At the core, we solve data analytics problems by combining data and 
algorithms. To combine data with algorithms we use computers. And to use 
computers, we need to *represent* the problem in a way that the computer 
understands. Computers can't deal with ambiguities.

Wait! But can't computers learn these days? Don't be foolish! Precisely 
defined models and algorithms are the foundation of machine learning–and 
any other data analytics technique.

Therefore, as you may have already concluded, your next step to solving your 
data analytics problem is to define a precise representation of it from the
description you already have. This is what we call *modeling*.

## Algorithms
Now that you have the data and the model of your problem, you want the 
computer to solve it. That's when algorithms kick in.

The type of algorithm you will use highly depends on the type of problem you 
have, including the size of your data, run time requirements, and desired
accuracy.

## Next steps
In the next sections, you will dive deeper into each one of the subjects 
listed above. 

By the end of this module, you should be ready to start implementing and 
solving your problem.
