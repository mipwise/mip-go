# Algorithms
Once you have modeled the problem, there are typically not a ton of 
algorithms you can consider. In some cases, you chose the modeling approach 
already thinking of the algorithm that you will be used to solve the problem.

Another common scenario is that you don't choose an algorithm itself but a 
tool that already has lots of algorithms implemented. The tool will then 
automatically make the decision for you or recommend you some options to choose
from.

Again, we can't tell you how to pick the right algorithm for each problem. 
Whether you like it or not, there is no recipe for this. The good news is 
that you can always leverage our community. And we expect you to do that now 
by contacting your Mip Mentor. He will help you to define what to do 
regarding your current projects.
