# Dealing with Clients

Dealing with clients can be very challenging. Especially at the beginning
of the engagement when trust has not yet been established. But it can also 
be extremely rewarding, which is typically the case when you start to 
deliver results and the client start to realize the value of the solution 
you have built for them.

## Managing expectations
It doesn't matter how good your solution is or how much effort you have put 
into it, if the client's understanding of your solution is not aligned with 
their expectations, they will be dissatisfied. And so will you.

The best way to manage expectations is to over-communicate. It doesn't mean 
composing a comprehensive statement of work (SOW), although that might help. 
You should aim to over-communicate on a regular basis. For example, be 
transparent about the progress you are making, be realistic about what you 
want to achieve and when, share partial results, and communicate about any 
issues as soon as they arise.

Keep in mind that over-promising is a short-term strategy. You probably 
don't want to play that game. Instead, know your capabilities, know your 
edge, and don't fake it. If you fake your edge, sooner or later your partners 
and clients will feel it, and they will distrust your work and disengage with 
you.

Here is a funny video (or maybe not so funny given that that's the reality 
for many folks out there) related to this topic:

## Keeping the conversation focused
Sometimes it can be challenging to keep the conversation focused. 
There are a few traps to be aware of:
* **The client gets obsessed with details that are not very relevant:** 

    In this situation, someone needs to politely drive the conversation 
    back to the agenda.

* **The client wants to address too many problems:** 
 
    It's important to take notes of all the problems, but we need to make 
    the call of which ones should be addressed now and which ones should be 
    saved for a future iteration, or even in a future project.

* **You fell into the temptation of starting to solve 
  the problem during the section:**

    This is a very common trap. Smart people, when they hear about a 
    problem, they want to start solving it immediately. But if we do so, 
    we are wasting the precious time we have to interact with the 
    client and understand their problem. Besides, unless we are in a 
    brainstorming section,  there is no benefit in throwing up to the 
    client the first idea that comes to our mind when we have the option 
    to think about the problem from multiple angles offline and share 
    only our best ideas.

## Avoiding excuses
Things will inevitably go wrong at times. When it happens, most people
start looking for excuses, putting themselves in a defensive position.
In some cases, people can get surprisingly creative in coming up with 
excuses. Don't waste your energy looking for excuses.  Instead, be 
transparent, be honest, look forward to finding a solution, and be proactive.
In other words, focus on the results.

## Making the client successful
**Your ultimate goal is to make the client successful, not just happy**.

Just keep in mind that making your client successful might require the 
courage to stand up and disagree with them.

You should always listen to what your client has to say and take that into 
account to making your decisions. But don't compromise the outcome of your 
projects by going along with the client and not leveraging your deepest wisdom
and expertise.

For example, imagine that you have understood the problem, its context, 
goals, and requirements. After all that, you feel very convinced that 
Technology A is the best option to attack the problem. But when you 
communicate it to the client he says that you should use Technology B 
instead. You ask why and the client says it's because everyone is talking
about Technology B these days. At that moment you could say "sure, that's 
fine" and please your client in the short term by doing what they want.
Alternatively, you could remember that you are the expert and start 
educating your client about the long-term benefits of Technology A 
versus the consequences of Technology B.

Perhaps it will take some time for the client to make up
his mind and agree with you, or you will even lose the battle. 
But if you just go along with your client, you both will pay the 
consequences in the long run. The client will distrust
you and your level of self-confidence will drop.

strategic, tactical, and operational.
