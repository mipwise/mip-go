# Types of Decision Problems

Business people usually classify their decision problems into three main categories
within the context of an organization:

## Strategic 
These are long-term sporadic decisions. For example, the organization might 
expect significant growth over the next 5-10 years and is planning to open 
new facilities. How many facilities, where, and when to build them, are 
examples of strategic decisions.

This type of decision involves a lot of uncertainties.

## Tactical 
These are decisions that impact operations on the mid-term horizon, like 
weeks or months, and take place quite regularly. For example, after 
forecasting the demand for the upcoming weeks, a retailer needs to decide on 
how much to order from its suppliers.

Typically, there are uncertainties involved in tactical decisions, but they 
are much more manageable compared with the strategic scenario.

## Operational 
Now we are talking about the type of decisions that organizations have to 
make on a regular basis, perhaps daily or even in intervals of minutes. 
In this scenario, the data might even be deterministic, but it changes 
very frequently. 

As an example, think of a food delivery company. As new orders arrive, they 
have to plan for the most efficient way to deliver them on time.
