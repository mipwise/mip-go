# Develop

Welcome to the *Develop* module!

The most intensive and exciting part of your journey is about to begin!

In this module, you will find lots of resources to develop software 
solutions for your projects and help your clients to leverage the true power 
of combining data and algorithms to support their decision-making process.

If you are not from a computer science background, the sentence "develop 
software solutions" might sound a bit intimidating to you. But remember, 
knowing how to program is not a pre-requisite here, only the basics
of Python are expected. So even if you feel intimidated right now, most likely
this is still the right program for you.

In the next section, we will clarify what we mean by software and how we 
deliver them to end-users.
