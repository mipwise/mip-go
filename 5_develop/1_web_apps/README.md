# Purpose-Built Web Applications
Development in the Mip Go program has a very clear purpose: building web 
applications (web apps, for short) tailored to solve specific problems.

More specifically, a web app is an application that the user can access 
through the internet browser and perform tasks such as upload and edit data, 
configure parameters, execute engines, visualize and edit outputs, and 
analyze scenarios.

To add more color, we ask you to read the article below, which was written 
by Aster Santana in 2019 (published in 2020). But before you start reading 
the article, let's provide some context.

Aster wrote the article while he was an employee of Opex Analytics, which 
was a consulting firm in the field of data analytics. Opex was one of the 
pioneers in delivering software, i.e., web apps, as a result of a consul
ting engagement. To do that, Opex had its own app deployment platform, 
which is referred to as *Enframe* in the article but later was renamed to 
*OpenX*.

Also, as you will see, the article touches on many of the topics already
covered in this program. So it will be a good reviewing exercise for you. In 
particular, Aster mention in the article three major steps to solve a 
business problem: 
1) Understanding the problem
2) Building the solution
3) Delivering the solution to users

You can probably see how it gets mapped to the D-Wise framework. The only 
difference is that D-Wise has an extra item, Define, that leaves between 1) 
and 2).

## What if my client is not looking for a web app?
Clients might not be looking for apps because they are not aware of what an 
app is or how it can support their business. And even if they already 
recognize the benefits of an app, they might think it takes too long to 
build an app or that they are too expensive, as it has been historically.

But what if we told them that the extra effort to deploy an app is just a 
matter of setting up some configurations, something that you can do in minutes? 
In exchange, your client gets to see and interact with the solution before 
investing any resources in integrating it with their system, or doing 
whatever they planned to do originally. It's like having free trials of the 
solution, and after each trial having the option of suggesting 
customizations. Truly an Agile approach.

It is really possible? Our answer is: absolutely!

## Mip Hub
Mip Wise has its own app deployment platform, [Mip Hub][mip-hub]. As you 
would expect, the extra effort to deploy an app on Mip Hub is only marginal 
work (actually, no extra work at all if you go with the default deployment) 
on top of the development of the solution engine itself and requires no 
knowledge about front-end development. This means that shortly you will also 
be deploying apps!

In addition, we not only aim to teach you to deploy custom apps, but we will 
also train you to develop outstanding solutions (it will just happen that they 
will be deployed in the form of apps). To achieve that, you will need to 
follow some programming best practices that we will help you to adopt and 
cultivate throughout this program.

In the end, the price you pay to build a custom, reusable, and reliable, 
software in the form of a web app is to write normal and good Python code! 

## Next steps
Before you move ahead, we recommend that you write down your main takeaways 
from Aster's article, and any other thoughts you might have. It's for your 
own future reference. You can use the *My notes* section below as we had 
recommended in the
[Next Steps](../../2_documentation/next_steps/README.md) section of 
the Documentation module.

📝 **Tip:** 
*You can easily search for your notes across all modules and sections by 
hitting `CTRL + SHIFT + F` and typing in **my notes** or anything else that 
you are looking for.*
