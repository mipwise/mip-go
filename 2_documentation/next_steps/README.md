# Next Steps

**Congratulations!**

You have covered the *Documentation Module*. This is a measurable
step towards your goal of solving real-world analytics problems.
Soon you will also be contributing to driving more intelligence power
into production and supporting better decision-making.

We expect that you will re-visit this module every time you need to 
remember how to create a table in Markdown, how to open a Jupyter Notebook,
or how to type a math equation, for example.

📝 **Tip:** 
*Think of this program as a toolbox. Each module here has tools that 
you may end up using at some point. Also, now that you already know how
to use Markdown, you can add your own content and personal notes 
(see the example below).*

Your next step is to start applying what you have already seen.
After all, Mip Way is a *training program*, and we know that 
**meaningful and deliberate practice is the only way to truly develop
new skills**.

However, we understand that different people have different interests
and derive meaning differently from the experiences they have.
Therefore, we ask you to contact your Mip Mentor now who will help
you to identify an exciting project for you.

## My notes

We encourage you to create subsections like this one at the bottom of
each section for your own future reference. 

For example, suppose that you found a Markdown trick that you liked. 
You can then go to the Markdown section and add your new trick, so you can 
easily find it next time you need it. 

Or maybe you found an interesting website. 
Then you can save the link in the respective section.

Perhaps it's the PDF of an interesting article or some other useful document.
You can also save a copy of that inside the directory of the respective
section.

In addition, you may want to add notes of things that worked or didn't 
work for you as you tried to apply the content of a specific section. 
It may be useful in the future when you revisit that section.

Finally, you will continue to have access to all your work from
anywhere by making commits and pushing it to GitHub as we have shown you
earlier. What a good combination! You keep personalizing this program
for yourself while practicing some basic VCS operations.
