# Documentation

Welcome to the Documentation module!

At Mip Wise, we strongly believe that every good solution deserves to be 
well-documented.

However, when people think about documentation, they typically imagine a 
long and boring manual. As expected, not many people feel motivated to write 
such types of documents. But no worries, that is not the type of 
documentation we are talking about. 

### I'm not convinced yet 😐
All right! First and foremost,
**we write documentation for ourselves and those collaborating with us.**

We got very good reasons for that:
- [X] Documentation leads us to **review, reorganize, and rethink our 
  approach**, whether it's in the discover, define, develop, or deployment 
  phase. As a result, we always end up with a better version of whatever we 
  are doing after some documentation work;
- [X] Documentation help us to **share our proposed approach** with 
  stakeholders and collaborator to collect feedback even before 
  implementation. This exercise typically leads us to save a lot of 
  time that otherwise would be spent in fixing or reworking the solution. 
- [X] Documentation makes it much easier to **onboard new collaborators** 
  to our project. If people can quickly understand what we are doing, they 
  will be in a much better position to use our solution and collaborate 
  with us;
- [X] Documentation is essential for **maintenance and future expansions a 
  solution**. It holds true even if we, the original developers of the 
  solution, will be the ones maintaining and expanding the solutions, 
  because we will likely have forgotten a lot of details after a few weeks.
- [X] Documentation is also important when it comes to **sell our 
  solution**, of course. Good documentation will make it clear what the 
  solution is intended for and how it can be used. If it sounds difficult 
  to use, even if it's not, people will not buy it.

We could keep adding lots of items to this list to motivate you further.
But what we want to emphasize is that writing documentation for analytics 
projects may be much easier than you might think.

### It's getting more interesting 🙂
People across many communities have done a great job in developing tools to 
make writing documentation as convenient as possible. 

We will highlight four technologies that are great examples of that:
* **Markdown:** Used for general-purpose documentation.
* **LaTeX:** Designed for typing math expressions.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for writing and executing code, 
  visualizing data, and writing documentation
* **Docstring:** The standard way of documenting code.
