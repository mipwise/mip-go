# Docstring

Docstring is used to document code. In Python, in particular, it’s 
considered a good practice to start a function (also modules, classes, and 
methods) with a docstring that says what the function does, in some cases 
including details about inputs and outputs of the function.

We strongly encourage any aspiring Python developer to spend a time 
going through the [PEP 252][1] webpage to learn more about docstrings and 
some widely adopted conventions around how to use them. Alternatively, you 
can study the docstring documentation of a professional package such as 
Numpy or Pandas.

When docstring documentation is created according to the conventions, one 
can use a package such as [Sphinx][2], to generate a beautiful HTML 
documentation of the entire code! We will eventually come back to this.
