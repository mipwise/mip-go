# LaTeX
Now that you have seen how to write documentation using Markdown and
Jupyter Notebook, we can show you how to mix the two to get pretty 
math equations. It's very simple, you only need to learn some basic LaTeX syntax.

As said in the webpage of the [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/) itself, 
LaTeX is a document preparation system. Typically, LaTeX is used to prepare high-quality 
scientific documents, such as scientific papers and books. We don't need all of that. 
We only want to type math expressions, such as summations, integrals, and fractions.

All you need to do is to wrap LaTeX commands with dollar signs. For example,
`$x_i$` gives x subscript i. And `$\sum_i x_i$` gives a summation of `x_i`.

We have created a Jupyter Notebook with lots of examples (from very basic to more
complex ones) for you to play with. To open it, click [here](../3_latex/latex.ipynb).
