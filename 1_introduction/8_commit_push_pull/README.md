# Commit, Push, and Pull
Since you have cloned the Mip Go repository, your environment is not
only set up with the Mip Go program but also with GitHub. This
means that you can synchronize the local copy of this repository
with the version on the cloud.

To understand how it works and to start using it, we will show you 
how to use the most basic VCS (version control system) operations:
commit, push, and pull. We will dive deeper into other VCS operations
later in the program.

With these basic operations, you will be able to synchronize
changes in your local version with the version in the clouds.

## Making changes
To make a meaningful change, type down your answer to the following question:

*Without reasoning about what you think is possible and what is not,
what would be the ideal outcome of this program for you?*

> Write down our answer here

We will come back to this later.

## Keeping track of changes
As you typed down your answer, you may have noticed a blue highlight next 
to the line numbers on the left. That's the VCS (version control system) 
letting you know that changes have been made there. The name of the file, 
`README.md`, inside `8_commit_push_pull`, should have also turned blue.


These highlights help keep track of all the changes made in the code.
Or better yet, all the changes made while trying to accomplish a specific
task, such as fixing a bug, making an enhancement, or just a small edit
like you did above by answering a question.

Before you move on to start working on the next task, it's a good idea
to save the current changes in the timeline of the project. We do that
by making a **commit**.

🗒️ **Note:** 
*Files are saved automatically to your local machine as you edit them in 
Pycharm. What a commit does is register a set of changes, so you can
keep track of the whole history of the project.*

## Committing your changes
To commit your answer above, click on the **Commit** button in the 
top-right corner (green checkmark) and select the file you want to commit 
(there should be only one, which is this `README`). Then write a message 
that will help you to identify this commit in the timeline of the project 
and click **Commit**.

📝 **Tip:** 
*In this project, you can start your commit message with the name of the 
section (commit_push_pull in the case of this section), so it will be 
easier to track them later in the history. Here is an example:*
```text
commit_push_pull: wrote about what would be the ideal outcome of this 
program for me
```

Once you are done, the blue highlights will disappear, and you can start
working on a new task.

## Making new changes
As a second task, list below a few strengths of yours that you think will help
you to make significant contributions as an analytics professional:

Once you are done, make another commit.

## Pushing commits
The two commits you did above were saved to your local machine only. To make 
them available on GitHub (so that you can access your changes from another 
machine, for example), you need to **push** your commits.

To do so, just click on the **Push** button in the top-right corner
(green arrow).

## Pulling commits
Now, if you want to access your changes from another machine, you can simply 
make a **pull**. Just click on the **Update Project** button in the 
top-right corner (blue arrow) of the IDE in that machine to have the version 
in there updated with the changes you have committed.

It works the same way when you are collaborating with others. You make 
commits and eventually push them all. The people collaborating with you make 
a pull to synchronize their version of the project with yours. Of course, it 
can go both ways. In which case, there can be conflicts of versions. We will 
come back to this topic later.

## Next steps
You may have heard stories of people who failed in learning GitHub. It 
typically happens when people try to learn everything in one go without 
practice. 

That's why we will encourage you to practice commit, push, and pull, for a 
while before we introduce new VCS concepts. And by the time we do so, you 
will already be quite comfortable with these three basic operations.
