# Categorization of Data Analytics

Data analytics is the practice of using algorithms to extract information from available data. 
Among other things, the type of algorithm we will use depends on the type
of questions we are trying to answer.

Therefore, it's appropriate to classify the questions, or data analytics itself, into three 
categories as follows:

* **Descriptive:** How the system has behaved historically?
* **Predictive:** How the system will behave in the future?
* **Prescriptive:** What actions can we take to improve the future behavior
  of the system?

It's important to keep in mind that the ultimate goal of data analytics is to
support decision-making. 

## When decisions are obvious
In some cases, decisions are obvious once the output from
descriptive or predictive analytics becomes available. For example, you may 
easily decide whether to go to the beach or to the cinema once you see the 
weather forecast. In this example, a quick look at your phone can support 
the decision-making process. In fact, data visualization has become very 
popular because it does the trick of supporting decisions (not necessarily 
optimized decisions) in many situations.

## When decisions are not obvious
In most cases, however, the decision is not so obvious. For example, 
knowing how many matches will be in the next national soccer tournament, 
which are the teams participating, fields availability, and the expected number 
of viewers, doesn't tell the organizers how they should schedule the matches. 
In addition, depending on how much complexity is involved (such as
balancing between home and away games, travel, and revenue from advertising), 
the use of algorithms may be required. In other words, prescriptive 
analytics may be required when decisions are not obvious.

There are also cases where descriptive and predictive analytics are no 
longer required (because the system is already very well understood, for 
example), but making wise decisions is a very hard task. Consider for 
instance the carrier problem in which thousands of parcels are to be shipped 
across the country in a timely manner while respecting hubs' capacity
and minimizing operational costs.

## Conclusion
In summary, it's important to distinguish the different types of analytics 
so that the right type of algorithm/technology is employed in the right 
situations. After all, what is the point in predicting demand with 96% 
accuracy, for instance, and then using rules-of-thumb to plan production, 
inventory, and distribution? 
Similarly, it doesn't make sense to optimize operations when there is not enough
visibility on the future demand, for example.
