# Setting Up Pycharm

Until now, you have probably been following this program on GitHub, straight 
from your web browser. But now it's time to change the environment. We want 
to make sure you get very familiar with the integrated development 
environment (IDE) as soon as possible, so you can start to feel the real 
experience of doing analytics.

## Why start from an IDE?
At first, if you are a beginner in programming, it might feel overwhelming 
to see so many tabs and bottoms once you launch Pycharm and open up your 
first project. That's why online courses will often provide you with a 
simple console, right there in the web browser, where you can write and 
execute some lines of code without worrying about anything else. 

If you have watched some YouTube videos on how to program in Python, you 
may have gone through the exercise of writing some code in a text file that 
you save with a `.py` extension and then go to the command line to execute 
Python on it. Some others will take a step further and encourage you to use 
a Jupyter Notebook (which we will also do at some point, mostly for writing 
documentation and prototyping ideas).

We understand the motivation behind these practices. There is a very good 
intention to make things easier for those who are starting. The goal is to 
let you focus on learning the programming syntax, practicing some programming 
tricks, learning how to use a package, etc. We have the exact same intentions.

But there is a catch with the approaches above. The moment you feel 
motivated and decide to work on an actual project, perhaps your own problem, 
you get stuck because you realize that you can't (or it doesn't make sense 
to) build the whole project in a single script, and you don't know how to 
organize and work with multiple files!

That's one of the reasons why professional developers use an IDE like Pycharm.
Collaboration, versioning, debugging, and autocompletion, are all 
compelling reasons as well, but we will keep that discussion for later.

## What if I have never used an IDE like this before?
The good news is that we have figured out a way to get you started with Pycharm
without you having to worry about all the complexities. And when you realize,
the complexities will no longer be an issue for you. 😉

Therefore, you will now continue to follow the steps of this program in Pycharm!

Once in Pycharm, you will still be able to navigate this content the same 
way you have been doing in here. The only difference is that you are going 
to be working inside a professional environment where soon you will be 
building solutions to real-world problems.

## Installation
There are three versions of Pycharm: Professional, Community, and Edu.

We recommend the Community edition, which is free of cost and has all the 
functionalities we need throughout the Mip Go program and beyond.

There are very detailed installation instructions on the official webpage:  
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html

As always, if you need any help, don't hesitate in reaching out to your Mip 
Mentor. While it's important to spend some time trying to figure out things 
on your own, don't spend too much time on it because you might lose momentum.
Remember, one of the key distinctions of the Mip Go program is our support 
(provided by humans). So make sure to leverage that.

## Configurations
Here are some configurations that may improve your experience when reading and
writing content in Pycharm.
### Change the font size
You might find it useful to be able to change the font size of the editor with 
`CTRL + Mouse Wheel`, just like you do on a web browser. To do that, go to  
`File > Settings > Editor > General`  
and check the appropriate boxes under the 
*Mouse Control* section.
### Text wrapping
It may be difficult to read the row version of a markdown that contains 
lengthy lines of text in it. Lengthy lines can be the result of the
copy-and-paste, for example. Or if you are using a small monitor, such as on 
a laptop, even a line that is 60-characters long may force you to scroll 
left and right.

To solve this problem, as reader, go to  
`File > Settings > Editor > General > Soft Wraps`  
and check the box for "Soft-wrap these files" with "*.md" included in the list.

As an editor, you can change when and how text gets wrapped as you type it. 
To do that, go to  
`File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Markdown`  
and change the value of "Wrap on typing" to "Yes". You can also change the 
value of "Hard wrap at" to, let's say 80 if you think that the default of 
120 is too long.
