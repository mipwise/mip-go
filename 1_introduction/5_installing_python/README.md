# Installing Python
The very first step to set up your machine is to install
Python, if you haven't done that yet, of course.

You can download Python straight from its
website: [www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After you download the latest version available in there,
double-click o the executable to start the installation the same
way you would do with any other software.

📝 **Tip:** 
*If you are on Windows, you may see a checkbox giving you the option to add 
Python to the path. If so, go ahead and check that box.*

Once you are done, move to the next section to install 
and set up Pycharm.
