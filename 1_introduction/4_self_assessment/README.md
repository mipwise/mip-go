# Self-Assessment

We don't believe that everyone should be doing the same thing, studying the 
same content in the same order and at the same time, solving the exact same 
problems in the exact same way. There must be some reasonable degree of 
freedom. It doesn't have to be too much freedom. It only has to be enough 
for you to steer what you do towards the things that interest you the most,
that leverage your skills, the things that you are good at doing. Because 
that's when you give your best and achieve what you want.

So you need to know what you want, what your interests and strengths are.

To help you to identify these things (and perhaps learn something new about 
yourself today), we  have put together a couple of questions for you to answer. 
Please answer them to yourself. And write down your answers as completely 
as you can. If you feel like you want to write a complete essay for each 
question, go for it! And don't feel pressured to answer them all in one go, 
take your time.

1. What prompted you to take the Mip Go program and what are you keen to accomplish throughout this program?
2. What are the things you would probably do for free, but it would be great if you could get paid for?
3. What are the things that you consider yourself good at and what makes you think so?
4. Suppose you no longer had to worry about money, what would you do with your life?
5. Role models are people that we aspire to be like them, at least in some aspects. 
   List some of your role models (if any) and what you admire in them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider discussing your answers to these questions with your Mip Mentor. 
It may be a good time to schedule a one-one section with him/her to discuss 
and plan your training track anyway.
